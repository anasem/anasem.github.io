I'm a post doctoral researcher in the [University of GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html)'s [Bioclimatology
group](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/67076.html)

My main research interests are micrometeorology, atmospheric trace gas
measurements, atmospheric turbulence, and the interactions between the biosphere
and the atmosphere.
